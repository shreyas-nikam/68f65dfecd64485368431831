### Section 1: Introduction to AlphaGenome Variant Explorer

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    This notebook explores the core functionality of AlphaGenome, an AI agent designed to interpret genetic variants and predict their regulatory effects across various biological modalities. We will simulate how users can interact with its conceptual tools, `score_variant_effect()` and `visualize_variant_effects()`, using synthetic data.

    The primary goal is to understand the impact of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) on gene regulation. AlphaGenome quantifies this impact using a `quantile_score`, which indicates how extreme a variant's predicted effect is relative to a background distribution of other variants. A higher score suggests a stronger, more significant regulatory effect.

    The `quantile_score` can be conceptualized as:
    $$ \text{quantile\_score}(v) = P(\text{effect}(v') \leq \text{effect}(v)) $$
    where $v$ is the variant in question, $v'$ represents a random variant from a reference set, and $P$ is the probability. This score ranges from 0 to 1.

    We will also visualize these effects, such as changes in gene expression or chromatin accessibility, across a genomic region.

### Section 3: Generating Synthetic Genetic Variant Data

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    To simulate the user experience with AlphaGenome without relying on actual genetic data or external APIs, we will generate a synthetic dataset of genetic variants. This dataset will mimic realistic variant characteristics, including chromosome, genomic position, reference and alternate alleles, and organism. The data will confirm expected column names and data types for subsequent processing.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will define a Python function named `generate_synthetic_genetic_variants`.
    -   It will take parameters such as `num_variants`, `chromosomes_list`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, `alleles_list`, and `organisms_list`.
    -   It will randomly select values for each variant's attributes based on the input parameters.
    -   It will return a pandas DataFrame containing the synthetic variants.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will call `generate_synthetic_genetic_variants` with specific parameters:
    -   `num_variants=10`
    -   `chromosomes_list=["chr1", "chr3", "chr9", "chr19", "chr22"]`
    -   `min_pos=1_000_000`, `max_pos=100_000_000`
    -   `alleles_list=["A", "T", "C", "G"]`
    -   `organisms_list=["human", "mouse"]`
    The output DataFrame will be stored in a variable like `synthetic_variants_df`.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    We execute the `generate_synthetic_genetic_variants` function to create our initial set of 10 synthetic genetic variants. This dataset will serve as the input for simulating AlphaGenome's predictions. The small number of variants ensures the notebook runs quickly, meeting the performance constraints.

---

### Section 4: Generating Synthetic AlphaGenome Predictions (Scores)

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    AlphaGenome predicts the functional consequences of genetic variants, providing quantitative scores like `quantile_score` and `log2fc_expression` across various modalities and tissue types. Here, we generate synthetic data to mimic these predictions. This data will be structured to allow for multi-modal and multi-tissue comparisons.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will define a Python function named `simulate_variant_effect_scoring`.
    -   It will take `variants_df`, `modalities_list`, `tissue_cell_types_list` as inputs.
    -   For each variant, modality, and tissue, it will generate a random `quantile_score` (between 0.001 and 0.999) and a `log2fc_expression` (between -2.0 and 2.0).
    -   It will return a pandas DataFrame with these simulated prediction scores.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will call `simulate_variant_effect_scoring` with:
    -   `variants_df=synthetic_variants_df`
    -   `modalities_list=["RNA-seq", "ATAC-seq", "ChIP-seq_histone", "Splice_Sites"]`
    -   `tissue_cell_types_list=["Liver", "Muscle", "Brain", "Lung", "Kidney"]`
    The output DataFrame will be stored in `synthetic_scores_df`.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    By running `simulate_variant_effect_scoring`, we populate a DataFrame with synthetic prediction scores for our generated variants across different modalities and tissues. This mimics the output of AlphaGenome's `score_variant_effect()` tool and provides the quantitative basis for our subsequent analysis and visualizations.

---

### Section 5: Generating Synthetic AlphaGenome Visualizations (Trend Data)

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    AlphaGenome also provides visualizations of variant effects across genomic regions. To replicate this, we will generate synthetic data for a "trend plot," showing how a predicted effect (e.g., expression change) varies with genomic position relative to the variant center. This will demonstrate the visual output of the `visualize_variant_effects()` tool.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will define a Python function named `simulate_visualization_data`.
    -   It will take `selected_variant_id`, `selected_modality`, `selected_tissue`, `plot_interval_width`, `plot_interval_shift` as inputs.
    -   It will generate `genomic_position_relative` values within the specified interval around the variant center.
    -   It will generate a synthetic `predicted_effect_value` by simulating a peak or trough centered around the variant, with values gradually returning to baseline further away. For example, a Gaussian-like function could be used to generate values.
    -   It will return a pandas DataFrame suitable for plotting.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will call `simulate_visualization_data` with:
    -   `selected_variant_id=synthetic_variants_df['variant_id'].iloc[0]` (e.g., the first variant)
    -   `selected_modality="RNA-seq"`
    -   `selected_tissue="Liver"`
    -   `plot_interval_width=5000`
    -   `plot_interval_shift=0`
    The output DataFrame will be stored in `synthetic_trend_df`.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    This step generates a sample dataset for a genomic trend plot for one of our synthetic variants. This data simulates how AlphaGenome might show the predicted effect of a variant across a localized genomic region. This `synthetic_trend_df` will be used as a default for the interactive trend visualization.

---

### Section 6: Data Validation and Summary Statistics

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    Ensuring data quality is crucial for reliable analysis. This section performs basic validation checks on our synthetic datasets to confirm column names, data types, and the absence of critical missing values. It also provides summary statistics for numeric fields, which helps in understanding the distribution and range of our simulated predictions.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will define two Python functions:
    1.  `validate_data(df, expected_cols, expected_dtypes, critical_na_cols)`:
        -   Checks if `df` contains all `expected_cols`.
        -   Verifies if column data types match `expected_dtypes`.
        -   Asserts that there are no missing values in `critical_na_cols`.
        -   Logs any discrepancies.
        -   Returns `True` if valid, `False` otherwise.
    2.  `display_summary_statistics(df)`:
        -   Calculates and returns `df.describe()` for numeric columns.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will:
    1.  Define `expected_variant_cols`, `expected_variant_dtypes`, `critical_variant_na_cols` for `synthetic_variants_df`.
    2.  Call `validate_data(synthetic_variants_df, ...)`.
    3.  Call `display_summary_statistics(synthetic_variants_df)`.
    4.  Repeat steps 1-3 for `synthetic_scores_df` using appropriate expected columns and types.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    By executing the validation and summary statistics functions, we confirm the structural integrity and basic characteristics of our synthetic variant and prediction data. This step is vital for ensuring that our simulated data is robust enough for demonstration, mirroring real-world data quality checks. The output helps us quickly understand the range of `quantile_score` and `log2fc_expression` values generated.

### Section 7: Interactive Inputs: Variant Selection

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    One of the key features of the AlphaGenome agent is its ability to take user-specified genetic variant details as input. This section demonstrates this by creating interactive widgets that allow users to select a variant from our synthetic dataset. This simulates the "Variant Input Form" feature.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will use `ipywidgets.Dropdown` to create an interactive selector.
    -   The dropdown will list the `variant_id` from `synthetic_variants_df`.
    -   An `observe` function will be defined to update a global `selected_variant_id` variable whenever the dropdown value changes.
    -   The function will display the selected variant's details (chromosome, position, alleles, organism) to confirm the selection.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will create and display the `ipywidgets.Dropdown` populated with `variant_id`s.
    It will register the `observe` callback to update `selected_variant_id`.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    This interactive dropdown allows users to easily select a specific synthetic genetic variant. The selected variant ID will then be used as input for subsequent prediction simulations and visualizations, mimicking a user interacting with the AlphaGenome agent's variant input form. Inline help text, "Select a genetic variant from the generated synthetic dataset," is implicitly provided by the dropdown label.

---

### Section 8: Interactive Inputs: Modality and Visualization Parameters

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    The AlphaGenome agent allows users to specify which modalities they are interested in and fine-tune visualization parameters. This section provides interactive widgets for selecting a modality (e.g., RNA-seq, ATAC-seq) and adjusting parameters like the genomic interval width and shift from the variant center for the trend plots. These controls simulate the "Modality Selection" and "Parameter Sliders" features.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will use `ipywidgets.Dropdown` for modality selection and `ipywidgets.IntSlider` for visualization parameters.
    -   A dropdown will be created for `modality` with options from `modalities_list`.
    -   Two sliders will be created for `plot_interval_width` (e.g., 1000 to 10000 bp) and `plot_interval_shift` (e.g., -2000 to 2000 bp).
    -   `observe` functions will be defined for each widget to update global `selected_modality`, `plot_interval_width_param`, and `plot_interval_shift_param` variables.
    -   A descriptive label and inline help text will accompany each control.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will create and display the `ipywidgets.Dropdown` and `ipywidgets.IntSlider` instances.
    It will register the `observe` callbacks for each widget.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    These interactive controls enable users to customize the specific biological context (modality) and visual scope for their variant effect predictions. This directly demonstrates how users could influence the `visualize_variant_effects()` tool's output within an AI agent framework. The sliders and dropdowns offer intuitive control, along with help text for clarity.

### Section 9: Simulating `score_variant_effect()` and Displaying Summary

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    This section simulates the execution of AlphaGenome's `score_variant_effect()` tool based on the user-selected variant and modality. It then presents a summary of the predicted functional consequences, focusing on the `quantile_score` values. This directly showcases the "Results Summary" feature.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will define a Python function named `display_variant_scores_summary`.
    -   It will take `selected_variant_id` and `selected_modality` as inputs.
    -   It will filter the `synthetic_scores_df` to show only the scores for the chosen variant and modality across all tissue/cell types.
    -   It will present these filtered results in a clearly formatted pandas DataFrame.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will call `display_variant_scores_summary` using the current values of `selected_variant_id` and `selected_modality` (from interactive widgets).

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    Executing this cell provides a concise tabular summary of the predicted effects for the selected variant and modality. This output mimics the quantitative `quantile_score` values that AlphaGenome would generate, allowing users to quickly grasp the predicted impact across different tissues or cell types. The table helps to consolidate and interpret the raw prediction data.

---

### Section 10: Explanation of `quantile_score`

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    The `quantile_score` is a critical metric provided by AlphaGenome to quantify the predicted effect of a genetic variant. It measures how "extreme" the observed effect of a variant is compared to a null distribution of effects from other, typically non-functional, variants.

    Specifically, a `quantile_score` of $0.99$ means that the variant's predicted effect is stronger than $99\%$ of the effects observed in the reference distribution. Conversely, a score of $0.01$ would mean it's weaker than $99\%$ of the reference.

    Let $E(v)$ be the predicted effect of a variant $v$ (e.g., change in gene expression). Let $D$ be the distribution of effects for a large set of background variants. The `quantile_score` is defined as:
    $$ \text{Quantile Score}(v) = P(E(v') \leq E(v) \mid v' \in D) $$
    This provides a normalized and easily interpretable measure of effect size.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    No function implementation in this cell. This cell purely provides conceptual explanation.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    No code execution in this cell.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    This section deepens the understanding of the `quantile_score`, providing necessary context for interpreting the numerical results from AlphaGenome. By explaining its definition and implications, users can better appreciate the significance of the predicted variant effects.

### Section 11: Interactive Visualization: Trend Plot (Gene Expression/Chromatin Accessibility)

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    This visualization, a trend plot, showcases how a variant's predicted effect, such as gene expression change or chromatin accessibility, varies across a genomic region. This directly corresponds to the interactive visualizations from the `visualize_variant_effects()` tool and demonstrates the "Trend Plot (Line/Area)" feature. The plot interval width and shift from the variant center are dynamically controlled by the user.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will define a Python function named `plot_variant_effect_trend`.
    -   It will take `selected_variant_id`, `selected_modality`, `selected_tissue`, `plot_interval_width`, `plot_interval_shift` as inputs.
    -   It will call `simulate_visualization_data` to generate new synthetic trend data based on the current interactive parameter values.
    -   It will use `plotly.express.line` or `plotly.express.area` to create an interactive plot:
        -   X-axis: `genomic_position_relative`
        -   Y-axis: `predicted_effect_value`
        -   Title: Clearly indicates variant, modality, and tissue.
        -   Labels: "Relative Genomic Position (bp)" and "Predicted Effect Value".
    -   It will provide a `matplotlib.pyplot` fallback for static display.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will create an `ipywidgets.interactive_output` widget.
    It will bind `plot_variant_effect_trend` to the current values of `selected_variant_id`, `selected_modality`, `selected_tissue`, `plot_interval_width_param`, and `plot_interval_shift_param`.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    By adjusting the sliders for plot interval width and shift, users can dynamically explore the simulated effect profile of the chosen variant. This interactive plot visually demonstrates how AlphaGenome allows biologists to pinpoint the precise genomic regions affected by a variant and understand the magnitude and pattern of these effects for a selected modality and tissue.

---

### Section 12: Interactive Visualization: Relationship Plot (Quantile Score vs. Tissue Type)

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    Understanding how a variant's effect translates across different tissue or cell types is crucial. This relationship plot (scatter plot) allows users to examine correlations between `quantile_score` values for a selected variant across different contexts. This corresponds to the "Relationship Plot (Scatter Plot)" feature. For simplicity, we will compare the `quantile_score` of the selected variant in one tissue type against another.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will define a Python function named `plot_quantile_score_relationship`.
    -   It will take `selected_variant_id`, `selected_modality`, `tissue1`, `tissue2` as inputs.
    -   It will filter `synthetic_scores_df` for the `selected_variant_id` and `selected_modality`, then pivot the data to have `tissue_cell_type` as columns.
    -   It will use `plotly.express.scatter` to create an interactive scatter plot:
        -   X-axis: `quantile_score` for `tissue1`.
        -   Y-axis: `quantile_score` for `tissue2`.
        -   Title: Indicates variant, modality, and tissues being compared.
        -   Labels: "Quantile Score in [Tissue 1]" and "Quantile Score in [Tissue 2]".
    -   It will provide a `seaborn.scatterplot` fallback for static display.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will create two `ipywidgets.Dropdown` widgets for `tissue1` and `tissue2` selection (from `tissue_cell_types_list`).
    It will then create an `ipywidgets.interactive_output` widget, binding `plot_quantile_score_relationship` to `selected_variant_id`, `selected_modality`, `tissue1_dropdown`, and `tissue2_dropdown`.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    This interactive scatter plot enables users to visually assess if a variant's predicted effect (quantified by `quantile_score`) is consistent or highly variable across different tissue contexts for a given modality. This is particularly useful for identifying tissue-specific regulatory effects or broadly acting variants, enhancing the interpretation of AlphaGenome's multi-modal predictions.

---

### Section 13: Interactive Visualization: Aggregated Comparison (Variant Effects Across Tissues)

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    To get a comprehensive overview of a variant's effects across multiple tissues or cell types for a chosen modality, an aggregated comparison plot is highly effective. This section provides a bar plot (or heatmap) to visualize `quantile_score` or `log2fc_expression` values, demonstrating the "Aggregated Comparison (Bar/Heatmap)" feature.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:
    This cell will define a Python function named `plot_aggregated_variant_effects`.
    -   It will take `selected_variant_id`, `selected_modality`, and `metric` (e.g., "quantile_score", "log2fc_expression") as inputs.
    -   It will filter `synthetic_scores_df` for the `selected_variant_id` and `selected_modality`.
    -   It will use `plotly.express.bar` to create an interactive bar chart:
        -   X-axis: `tissue_cell_type`
        -   Y-axis: `metric` (e.g., `quantile_score`)
        -   Title: "Predicted [Metric] for [Variant ID] in [Modality] Across Tissues".
        -   Labels: "Tissue/Cell Type" and "[Metric]".
        -   Color: `tissue_cell_type` for distinction.
    -   It will provide a `seaborn.barplot` fallback for static display.

*   **Code cell with execution of the function**:
    This cell will create a `ipywidgets.Dropdown` for `metric_selection` (e.g., "quantile_score", "log2fc_expression").
    It will then create an `ipywidgets.interactive_output` widget, binding `plot_aggregated_variant_effects` to `selected_variant_id`, `selected_modality`, and `metric_selection_dropdown`.

*   **Markdown cell with the explanation for the execution of the cell**:
    This bar plot offers a quick and clear comparison of the selected variant's impact across a range of tissues for a specific biological modality. This type of aggregated visualization is invaluable for identifying tissues where a variant has the strongest or weakest regulatory effects, supporting the understanding of its functional consequences.

### Section 14: Interpreting Results

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    Interpreting the multi-modal predictions and visualizations from AlphaGenome requires careful consideration of several factors:

    1.  **`Quantile Score` Significance**: High `quantile_score` values (e.g., > 0.95 or < 0.05) indicate a strong, potentially functional effect. Scores closer to $0.5$ suggest an effect similar to background variants.
    2.  **Modality-Specific Effects**: A variant might have a strong effect in one modality (e.g., RNA-seq) but little to no effect in another (e.g., ATAC-seq). This suggests a specific regulatory mechanism.
    3.  **Tissue/Cell Type Specificity**: Effects can vary greatly across different tissues. Identifying these specific patterns helps pinpoint the relevant biological contexts for the variant's function.
    4.  **Trend Plot Patterns**: Peaks or troughs in trend plots precisely at the variant's position indicate a direct, localized impact on the predicted effect, such as altered motif binding or expression.

    By combining insights from the numerical summaries and all three types of visualizations, researchers can build a comprehensive understanding of a genetic variant's regulatory role.

*   **Code cell with what function it should implement**:

### Section 15: Conclusion

*   **Markdown cell with the explanations and formulae**:
    This interactive Jupyter Notebook has provided a hands-on experience in exploring the conceptual capabilities of the AlphaGenome agent for genetic variant interpretation. Through synthetic data and interactive visualizations, we have demonstrated how an AI agent can make complex genomic analyses more accessible.

    We have seen how to:
    -   Simulate genetic variants and their multi-modal regulatory effects.
    -   Interpret `quantile_score` values as indicators of variant impact.
    -   Utilize interactive trend plots to visualize localized effects across genomic regions.
    -   Compare variant effects across different tissue types and modalities using relationship and aggregated comparison plots.

    This lab underscores the potential of AI agents, like AlphaGenome, to democratize access to advanced genomic insights, enabling biologists and researchers to focus on biological discovery rather than technical implementation details.
